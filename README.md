# Quiz Challenge
This project was created as an assignment for the PennLPS Fullstack Bootcamp.

## Objective
I was tasked with creating a functioning quiz game that will save and log hi-scores. There were several requirements in order for the quiz to be deemed successful.
- The quiz shoud have a start button that initiated a timer that also doubled as the final score for the player
- The quiz should let the user know if they are correct or incorrect for each answer. If the user is in fact incorrect, they will have a 10 seccond/ point penalty taken from their final score.
- Once the user has finished the game successfully, they will be able to save their score.

## Approach
I started the HTML process by sketching out how I wanted the page to look. I added CSS styling to make the page feel more appealing to the user. After I defined the default page loaded CSS, I added classes for the Correct/Incorrect notifications and game box.

I made the mistake of not pseudocoding the JS file prior to implementation. This left me with a dozen errors I needed to find solutions to. I used console logging often to ensure I was on the right path selecting DOM elements. During the process, I created a separate JS file and transferred the functioning pieces there while I figured out the rest of my code. 

## Final Statement/ Conclusion
The project taught me the value of pseudocoding the visualizing how I want my page to behave before I enter a single piece of code. I was able to meet the requirements for the quiz and I'm happy with the way the quiz has turned out.
